...............................................................................

Important Notes for Grading:

Previously there were login pages would take any credentials for demonstration of site structure, there is no true authentication as requested in project requirements. 
We later decided to remove these pages, there will be no login or authentication pages reflected in our site or database. 

Our site fulfills these use cases:
- add new books to the library stock (request from external source)
- change number of copies of an existing book (check out subtracts the availability) 
- add new patrons (sign up adds new patrons)
- Patrons can check out books (also changes the number of copies)
